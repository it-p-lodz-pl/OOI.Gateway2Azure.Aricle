# Message-Oriented-Middleware

## Preface

**Abstract** In the context of IT applications and especially in large organizations, integration of existing information systems into new IT environments poses many challenges. One of the biggest issue in this regard is dealing with the systems' heterogenity in terms of used programming languages, operating systems, or even data formats. In order to ensure communication between different information systems, developers must establish common interfaces. This chapter introduces middleware as a type of software which manages and facilitates interactions between applications across computing platforms. Besides a brief definition and overview of middleware, several of its characteristics are described. Furthermore, the differences between the three middleware categories (message-oriented, transaction-oriented and object-oriented middleware) are defined. In addition to these theoretical foundations, some practical implementations are presented.

## Excerpts from the text

This mechanism called Message-Oriented Middleware or MOM provides a clean method of communication between disparate **software entities**.
MOM can be defined as any **middleware infrastructure** that provides messaging capabilities.
MOM systems provide distributed communication on the basis of the **asynchronous inter-action model**;
MOM injects **a layer between senders and receivers**, which allows message senders and receivers to use this independent layer as an intermediary to exchange messages.
The **message queue** is a fundamental concept within MOM.
MOM **messages are autonomous** self-contained entities.
MMessage-Oriented Middleware provides an asynchronous, loosely coupled, flexible communication backbone.
Message-Oriented Middleware or MOM is a revolutionary concept in distribution allowing for communications between disparate software entities to be encapsulated into messages.

## Comment on Research Gate

From the `Curry, Edward. (2005). Message-Oriented Middleware. 10.1002/0470862084.ch1.` we may excerpt the fellowing sentences that may be considered as a contribution to the Middleware term definition.

- This mechanism called Message-Oriented Middleware or MOM provides a clean method of communication between disparate **software entities**.
- MOM can be defined as any **middleware infrastructure** that provides messaging capabilities.
- MOM systems provide distributed communication on the basis of the **asynchronous interaction model**;
- MOM injects **a layer between senders and receivers**, which allows message senders and receivers to use this independent layer as an intermediary to exchange messages.
- The **message queue** is a fundamental concept within MOM.
- MOM **messages are autonomous** self-contained entities.
- Message-Oriented Middleware provides an asynchronous, loosely coupled, flexible communication backbone.
- Message-Oriented Middleware or MOM is a revolutionary concept in distribution allowing for communications between disparate software entities to be encapsulated into messages.

Additionally, from the text, we can learn that middleware provides a vast variety of additional functionality supporting messages buffering, filtering, routing, storing, grouping, etc to name only a few.
