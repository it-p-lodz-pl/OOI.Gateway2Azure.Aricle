# Middleware definition

One of the biggest issue in this regard is dealing with the systemsâ€™ heterogenity in terms of used programming languages, operating systems, or even data formats. In order to
ensure communication between different information systems, developers must establish common interfaces.

Middleware is a type of communication software used to manage and facilitate interactions between applications across heterogenous data processing platforms.
The three middleware categories are defined:

- message-oriented,
- transaction-oriented
- object-oriented
