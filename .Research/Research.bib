  abstract  = {The contribution of this paper is a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) middleware solution for extending the reach, scale and functionality of content delivery networks (CDNs). The research problem of extending legacy CDN functionality towards user-to-user content networking and enhancing the CDN quality attributes of reach and scale are addressed. The proposed P2P middleware solution extends the reach and scale of CDNs to cover the digital home environment via specialized virtual multimedia home gateways and extends the legacy CDN functionality by enabling user-generated content sharing via the P2P extended CDN infrastructure.},

  abstract  = {In the context of IT applications and especially in large organizations, integration of existing information systems into new IT environments poses many challenges. One of the biggest issue in this regard is dealing with the systems' heterogenity in terms of used programming languages, operating systems, or even data formats. In order to ensure communication between different information systems, developers must establish common interfaces. This chapter introduces middleware as a type of software which manages and facilitates interactions between applications across computing platforms. Besides a brief definition and overview of middleware, several of its characteristics are described. Furthermore, the differences between the three middleware categories (message-oriented, transaction-oriented and object-oriented middleware) are defined. In addition to these theoretical foundations, some practical implementations are presented.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring older adults with wearable sensors and IoT devices requires collecting data from various sources and proliferates the number of data that should be collected in the monitoring center. Due to the large storage space and scalability, Clouds became an attractive place where the data can be stored, processed, and analyzed in order to perform the monitoring on large scale and possibly detect dangerous situations. The use of fuzzy sets in the monitoring and detection processes allows incorporating expert knowledge and medical standards while describing the meaning of various sensor readings. Calculations related to fuzzy processing and data analysis can be performed on the Edge devices which frees the Cloud platform from performing costly operations, especially for many connected IoT devices and monitored people. In this paper, we show a solution that relies on fuzzy rules while classifying health states of monitored adults and we investigate the computational cost of rules evaluation in the Cloud and on the Edge devices.},

abstract={Cloud computing is getting popular and IT giants such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM have started their cloud computing infrastructure. However, current cloud implementations are often isolated from other cloud implementations. This paper gives an overview survey of current cloud computing architectures, discusses issues that current cloud computing implementations have and proposes a Service-Oriented Cloud Computing Architecture (SOCCA) so that clouds can interoperate with each other. Furthermore, the SOCCA also proposes high level designs to better support multi-tenancy feature of cloud computing. © 2010 IEEE.},
