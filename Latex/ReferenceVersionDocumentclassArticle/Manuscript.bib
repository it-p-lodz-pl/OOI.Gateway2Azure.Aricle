  abstract  = {Information and Communication Technology has provided society with a vast variety of distributed applications. By design, the deployment of this kind of application has to focus primarily on communication. This article addresses research results on the systematic approach to the design of the meaningful Machine to Machine (M2M) communication targeting distributed mobile applications in the context of new emerging disciplines, i.e. Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things. This paper contributes to the design of a new architecture of mobile IoT solutions designed atop of the M2M communication and composed as multi-vendor cyber-physicals systems. The described reusable library supporting this architecture designed using the reactive interoperability archetype proves that the concept enables a systematic approach to the development and deployment of software applications against mobile IoT solutions based on international standards. Dependency injection and adaptive programming engineering techniques have been engaged to develop a full-featured reference application program and make the proposed solution scalable and robust against deployment environment continuous modifications. The article presents an executive summary of the proof of concept and describes selected conceptual and experimental results achieved as an outcome of the open-source project Object-Oriented Internet targeting multi-vendor plug-and-produce interoperability scenario.},

  abstract  = {HTTP as a transport protocol and HTML as a description language are the big winners selected by millions of people and they have led to the establishment of the World Wide Web enabling a straightforward possibility to publish new information and expose it in the context of its description. Unfortunately, this is a human-centric environment that cannot be easily adapted to an application-centric approach, which is required to provide distributed globally scoped real-time process control based on the machine to machine communication. The paper presents a generic architecture that can be recognized as a framework to deploy solutions targeting cyber-physical systems established as an integrated set of machines interconnected over the Internet. To support distributed globally scoped information processing solutions, inevitably the machines have to expose and update information in the context that can be used to describe and discover it by other machines. The globalization requires integration standardization. To fulfill this requirement it is also proposed to deploy this architecture using the OPC Unified Architecture industrial integration standard. The aim of this paper is to represent a first attempt towards the machine to machine meaningful communication implementation using existing standardized technologies in compliance with the Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things paradigms. On the basis of the proposed architecture selected machine roles as the processing units and related communication patterns and paths are analyzed in context of the semantics aware data interchange and meaningful data processing.},

  number   = {10-01},
  abstract = {In the Java community there's been a rush of lightweight containers that help to assemble components from different projects into a cohesive application. Underlying these containers is a common pattern to how they perform the wiring, a concept they refer under the very generic name of "Inversion of Control". In this article I dig into how this pattern works, under the more specific name of "Dependency Injection", and contrast it with the Service Locator alternative. The choice between them is less important than the principle of separating configuration from use.},

  abstract  = {The OPC Foundation defines standards for online data exchange between automation systems. They address access to current data (OPC DA), alarms and events (OPC A\&E) and historical data (OPC HDA). Those standards are successfully applied in industrial automation. The new OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) unifies the existing standards and brings them to state-of-the-art technology using service-oriented architecture (SOA). Main advantages of the new standard are: Platform-independent technology allows the deployment of OPC UA beyond current OPC applications only running on Windows-based PC systems. OPC UA can also run on embedded systems as well as Linux / UNIX based enterprise systems. The provided information can be generically modeled and therefore arbitrary information models can be provided using OPC UA. This book gives an easy to understand introduction into OPC UA and explains the concepts of the standard and other relevant topics that are not directly addressed by the standard.},

Many existing machine tools, handling and logistics systems provide a generic functionality that is not bound to a specific product. But this flexibility and reconfigurability on the level of individual resources is lost in automated systems that are limited to the production of a fixed set of product variants. We propose a unified abstraction for the skills provided by the available resources and the product-specific manufacturing requirements. From these high-level descriptions, executable manufacturing procedures are derived, exposed as services and dynamically orchestrated at runtime in order to achieve the manufacturing goals. © 2015 Walter de Gruyter Berlin.},

  abstract  = {In the context of IT applications and especially in large organizations, integration of existing information systems into new IT environments poses many challenges. One of the biggest issue in this regard is dealing with the systems' heterogenity in terms of used programming languages, operating systems, or even data formats. In order to ensure communication between different information systems, developers must establish common interfaces. This chapter introduces middleware as a type of software which manages and facilitates interactions between applications across computing platforms. Besides a brief definition and overview of middleware, several of its characteristics are described. Furthermore, the differences between the three middleware categories (message-oriented, transaction-oriented and object-oriented middleware) are defined. In addition to these theoretical foundations, some practical implementations are presented.},
