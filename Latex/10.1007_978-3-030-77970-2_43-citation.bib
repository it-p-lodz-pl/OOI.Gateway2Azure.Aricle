abstract="Optimization of industrial processes requires further research on the integration of machine-centric systems with human-centric cloud-based services in the context of new emerging disciplines, namely the fourth industrial revolution coined as Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things. The following research aims at working out a new generic architecture and deployment scenario applicable to that integration. AÂ reactive interoperability relationship of the communication parties is proposed to deal with the network traffic propagation asymmetry or assets' mobility. Described solution based on the OPC Unified Architecture international standard relaxes issues related to the real-time multi-vendor environment. The discussion concludes that the embedded gateway software component best suits all requirements and thus has been implemented as a composable part of the selected reactive OPC UA framework which promotes separation of concerns and reusability.",
