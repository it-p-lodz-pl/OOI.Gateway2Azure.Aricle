  abstract = {Shortening product lifecycles and small lot sizes require manufacturing systems to adapt increasingly fast. Many existing machine tools, handling and logistics systems provide a generic functionality that is not bound to a specific product. But this flexibility and reconfigurability on the level of individual resources is lost in automated systems that are limited to the production of a fixed set of product variants. We propose a unified abstraction for the skills provided by the available resources and the product-specific manufacturing requirements. From these high-level descriptions, executable manufacturing procedures are derived, exposed as services and dynamically orchestrated at runtime in order to achieve the manufacturing goals. © 2015 Walter de Gruyter Berlin.},
