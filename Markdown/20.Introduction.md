# Introduction

## Subject

Information and Communication Technology has provided society with a vast variety of new distributed applications. By design, the deployment of this kind of applications has to focus primarily on communication technologies. This article addresses further research on integration of this kind of applications in the context of new emerging disciplines, i.e. Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Internet of Things (IoT). New architecture is proposed for integration of the IoT solutions designed atop of M2M communication deployed and emerging cloud computing as multi-vendor cyber-physicals systems. The architecture is backed by a proof of concept reference implementation.

All of the applications designed atop of network communication can be grouped as follows:

- **human-centric** - information origin or ultimate information destination is an operator,
- **machine-centric** - information production, consumption, networking, and processing are achieved entirely without human interaction.

A typical **human-centric** approach is a web-service supporting, for example, a web UI to monitor conditions, and manage millions of devices and their data in a typical cloud-based IoT approach. It is characteristic that, in this case, any uncertainty and necessity to make a decision can be relaxed by human interaction. Coordination of robots behavior in a work-cell is a **machine-centric** example. In this case, it is essential that any human interaction is impractical or even impossible. This interconnection scenario requires the machine to machine communication (M2M) demanding multi-vendor devices integration.

From the M2M communication concept, a broader concept of a smart factory can be derived. In this concept, the mentioned robots are only executive parts of an integrated supervisory control system responsible for macro optimization of any industrial process composed into one whole. Deployment of smart factory concept requires interoperability on the mentioned above heterogenous environments.

This approach is called the fourth industrial revolution and coined as Industry 4.0. It is worth stressing that machines - or more general parts - interconnection is not enough, and additionally, parts interoperability has to be expected for the deployment of this concept. Muli-vendor integration makes communication standardization especially important. Highly-distributed solutions used to control real-time process aggregating islands of automation (e.g. production of renewable energy) additionally must leverage public communication infrastructure, namely the Internet. Really demanding is requirement that islands of automation is mobile, e.g. autonomous car passing a service area. In this case, the behavior of the automation island in relation to the environment in which it is located is particularly important. Now we are entering Internet of Things application domain.

## Article organization

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Sect. \ref*{sec.Machine-to-Machine-Interoperability} presents the generic architecture that is to be used as a foundation for further decisions addressing the systematic design of the multi-vendor cyber-physical systems. It focuses on the reusability and security of data processing. In Sect. \ref*{sec.DomainModel} open and reusable software model is presented. It~promotes a reactive interoperability pattern and a generic approach to establishing interoperability-context. A~reference implementation of this archetype is described in Sect. \ref*{sec.Implementation}. The most important findings and future work are summarized in Sect. \ref*{sec.conclusions}.
