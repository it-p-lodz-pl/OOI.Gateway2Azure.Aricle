## IoT

Internet of Things is all about

- Mobile data fetching – how to gather the data from mobile devices (things)
- Mobile data subscription – how to transfer the data over the Internet to a place where it could be subscribed.
- Mobile data consumption – data processing, computation

Mobile data fetching is related to variety of last mile communication technologies, for example RFID, WI-FI, VHF, etc. Subscription could be supported using messaging systems, e.g. AMQP. A good candidate to leverage consumption is OPC Unified Architecture.

To deploy this scenario

- the mobile data must be sent over the Internet using messages;
- the payload of these messages is consumed by an OPC Server responsible to expose it in the Address Space;
- the application as an OPC UA client consumes the exposed data and generates revenue for the end-user.The phrase "Internet of Things" started its life as the title of a presentation made in 1999 and aimed at explaining a new idea of radio frequency identification (RFID) in the context of the supply chain performance. It is clear that it doesn’t mean that someone has any right to control how others use the phrase, but my point is that a precise term definition is important for working together on: common rules, architecture, solutions, requirements, capabilities, limitations, etc. In practice having a common definition it is possible to check a selected technology, solution or product capabilities against requirements of the application entitled to use this term.

My proposal of the Internet of Things definition is as follows:

Internet of Things is all about:

- mobile data fetching – how to gather the data from mobile devices (things);
- mobile data subscription – how to transfer the data over the Internet to a place where it could be processed;
- mobile data processing – how to integrate the data into a selected application to improve process behavioral performance.

Data fetching is related to a variety of last mile communication technologies, for example RFID, WI-FI, VHF, Bluetooth, etc. Subscription could be supported using messaging systems, e.g. AMQP, MQTT, etc. A good candidate for leveraging data consumption is for example OPC Unified Architecture.
