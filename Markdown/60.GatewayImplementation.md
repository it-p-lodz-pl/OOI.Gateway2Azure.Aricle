> Domain model presenting relationship between the: Azure, PubSub Gateway, Device, Design and development tools

From the description covered by the Sec. and the Sec. the Azure supports the HTTP, AMQP, MQTT, but the PubSub Ethernet, UDP, AMQP, MQTT. If the Ethernet or UDP has been selected to build interconnection based on PubSub direc interoperability with the PubSub is impossible because the Azure doesn't offer these protocol as native communication services.

The Azure uses JSON based Data Transfer Object encoding and schema defined based on the solution metadata. The pubsub uses json and binary Data Transfer Object encoding. If JSON is used posibility to establich semantic contex depends on the Azure metadata definition. In case PubSub uses binary encoding stablishin inteconnection is imposible.

Azure and Pub uses different security mechanizms so establishing directtly security context is imposible at all

. For both the schema is different Data Transfer Object encoding

Described above differences of both solutions make this approach impractical and imposable to be applied in typical cases.
