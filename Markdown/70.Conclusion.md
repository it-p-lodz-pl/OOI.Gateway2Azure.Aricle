# Conclusion

The OPC UA PubSub to Azure gateway (`AzureGateway`) implementation has been just published on GitHub as the open-source (MIT licensed) as a part of the more general concept of the Object-Oriented Internet reactive networking. It is proof of the concept that

1. OPC UA PubSub can be implemented as a powerful standalone package - no C/S dependency
2. Azure interoperability can be implemented as an out-of-band communication (MQTT, AMQP, HTTP) - no PubSub dependency
3. Process data functionality can be composable at run-time - no programming required
