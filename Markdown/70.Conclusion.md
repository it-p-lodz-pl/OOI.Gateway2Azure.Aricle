# Conclusion

The OPC UA PubSub to Azure gateway (`AzureGateway`) implementation has been just published on GitHub as the open-source (MIT licensed) as a part of the more general concept of the Object-Oriented Internet reactive networking. It is proof of the concept that

1. OPC UA PubSub can be implemented as a powerful standalone package - no C/S dependency
2. Azure interoperability can be implemented as an out-of-band communication (MQTT, AMQP, HTTP) - no PubSub dependency
3. Process data functionality can be composable at run-time - no programming required

The described solution proves that it is possible tio implement Azure couple as ...

The \emph{DataRepository} represents data holding assets in the \emph{Reactive Application} and, following the proposed architecture, the \emph{IBindingFactory} interface is implemented by this external part. It captures functionality responsible for accessing the process data from \emph{LocalResources}. The \emph{LocalResources} represents an external part that has a very broad usage purpose. For example, it may be any kind of the process data source/destination, i.e.~\emph{Raw Data} or \emph{Address Space Management} (Fig. \ref*{fig_archit}). By design, the \emph{DataRepository} and associated entities, i.e.~\emph{Local Resources}, \emph{Consumer}, \emph{Producer} have been implemented as external parts, and consequently, the application scope may cover practically any concern that can be separated from the core \emph{Reactive Application} implementation.
