## Real-Time

- To meet the real-time distributed control requirements the cyber-physical system may use protocols applicable only to local computer networks (e.g. multicast IP, Ethernet, TSN). In this case interaction with the cloud requires remote agents. i.e. agents attached locally to the network.
- a supervisory control system to isolated islands of automation and all of them deal with the same real-time process
- A very important feature of the real-time systems is their intrinsic reliability
- a consistent sole representation of a distributed real-time process
- Cache is an intermediate storage of real-time process data.
