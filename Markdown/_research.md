## Real-Time

- To meet the real-time distributed control requirements the cyber-physical system may use protocols applicable only to local computer networks (e.g. multicast IP, Ethernet, TSN). In this case interaction with the cloud requires remote agents. i.e. agents attached locally to the network.
- a supervisory control system to isolated islands of automation and all of them deal with the same real-time process
- A very important feature of the real-time systems is their intrinsic reliability
- a consistent sole representation of a distributed real-time process
- Cache is an intermediate storage of real-time process data.

## General text

- as a standalone software part composable into the networking library using dependency injection that guaranties the most possible level of separation
- reactive interoperability M2M communication based on the OPC UA standard can be implemented as a powerful standalone library without dependency on the Client/Server session-oriented archetype
- Azure interoperability can be implemented as an external part employing out-of-band communication without dependency on the OPC UA implementation
- the proposed generic architecture allows that the gateway functionality is composable at run-time - no programming required

It is rather a plug-in providing additional functionality on the foundation of an existing cyber

Azure and Pub uses different security mechanism so establishing directly security context is imposable at all

. For both the schema is different Data Transfer Object encoding

Described above differences of both solutions make this approach impractical or evan imposable to be applied in typical cases.
